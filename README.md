## What works in 2020 on Windows 10

### Got this code from over here  
[Frets on Fire on Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fretsonfire/files/)

### Got this a potential dependency for PIL (may or may not be necessary for pillow as well)  
[Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable Package (x64)](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=15336)  

### I know it's sacrilege. Join me at your own risk  
[Python2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2718/)

### Old ass version of Pillow  
```bash
pip install pillow==2.2.1 cython numpy PyGame PyOpenGL  
```

## Run it!
```bash
python FretsOnFire\src\FretsOnFire.py
```
